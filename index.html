            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p> Harry is my hero  because he chases his dream. He stated off in a band called one direction and helped make many amazing songs while in the band. When the band broke up he stared making music of his own that people love and enjoy. He is also a still very supportive of his past band members and is one of the nicest and most genuine people you will every meet.
